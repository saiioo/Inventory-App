For APP.js


// Import Statements: The code starts with importing necessary dependencies such as React, InventoryList, InventoryItemForm, and a CSS file App.css. Make sure to install and import all the required dependencies before using them in your code.
// App Component: The code defines a functional component called App using an arrow function. The App component is the entry point of the application and serves as the main container for other components.
// JSX Markup: The return statement in the App component returns JSX markup, which represents the structure of the user interface. It includes a div element with a className of 'main-app' to apply a CSS class for styling purposes. Inside the div, there's an h1 element with a className of 'inven-heading' for displaying the heading "Inventory". Below the heading, there are two components rendered: InventoryItemForm and InventoryList.
// InventoryItemForm and InventoryList Components: The InventoryItemForm and InventoryList components are being used inside the App component. Make sure that these components are defined and imported correctly in your project.
// CSS Styling: The App.css file is imported to apply custom styles to the App component. Make sure that the file path is correct and the CSS styles defined in App.css are being applied as expected.
// Class and Classname: The usage of className instead of class attribute is appropriate in JSX because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. React uses className to define CSS classes for HTML elements rendered in JSX.
// Accessibility: Ensure that the components and UI elements in the App component are accessible and follow best practices for web accessibility.
// Error Handling: The code does not include error handling or validation for the form input in InventoryItemForm component. Consider adding appropriate validation and error handling logic to ensure a robust and reliable application.
// Code Organization: Ensure that the code is properly organized, following best practices for component structure, file structure, and separation of concerns.

If the showPopup state is true, it also renders a popup for updating the quantity of the item, which includes an input field for entering the updated quantity, and "Update" and "Cancel" buttons.
